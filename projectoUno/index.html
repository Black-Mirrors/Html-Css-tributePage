                  <br id="imageInfo">
                   <br>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her 
         discography spans multiple genres, and her songwriting—often inspired by her personal 
         life—has received critical praise and wide media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania,
         Swift moved to Nashville at age 14 to become a country artist. She signed a songwriting 
         deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine 
         Records in 2005.</br></br></p>

                    <strong><u>childhood and education</u></strong></br>
         Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, at the Reading Hospital in West 
         Reading, Pennsylvania. Swift's father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former 
         stockbroker for Merrill Lynch and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), 
         is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.</br></br>

                     <strong><u>2004 - 2008: Career beginnings and first album</u></strong></br>
         n Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, 
         Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[35][36] and formed a 
         lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[37] They began meeting for two-hour writing 
         sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[38] Rose thought the sessions were "some 
         of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what 
         happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. 
         And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.
